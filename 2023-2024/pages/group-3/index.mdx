### Vision Statement
Our vision is to revolutionize the field of rehabilitation by introducing an advanced, VR-powered Mirror Therapy program, specifically designed to transform the therapeutic journey for individuals with limb loss. We are dedicated to harnessing the immersive power of virtual reality to create a therapy experience that is not only highly effective but also engaging and emotionally uplifting.
### Problem Statement
Many bilateral amputees face limited access to effective and affordable phantom limb therapy. Traditional methods often lack accessibility and engagement. Our challenge is to develop a solution that bridges this gap.
### Project Overview
Our project extends beyond traditional therapy methods. By integrating cutting-edge VR technology with empathetic, user-centric design, we aim to significantly enhance the accessibility and efficacy of rehabilitation practices. This innovative approach is tailored to meet the unique challenges faced by bilateral amputees, providing them with a therapeutic experience that is both empowering and transformative.
