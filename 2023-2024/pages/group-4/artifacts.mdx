## Artifacts

### Project Architecture

#### Overall Project Design
The overall project design represents our event-driven architecture as a flow diagram, showing the flow of data from the input all the way to how the game environment is rendered.

#### Arm Flow
The arm flow displays how the input is given to the arm, and how the arm reacts to the input events it was given.

#### Input Flow
The input architecture represents the flow of data from the multiple different types of input to the game, and showing where and how that data is transformed before reaching the arm for control.

#### Level Flow
The level flow chart represents what the users will be doing and interacting with within the game level.

#### Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram represents how the end-user will interact with our product, and the actors that will play a role in using the software.
