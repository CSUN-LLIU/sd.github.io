## Artifacts

### Acknowledgement & Origin
The project was brought to us by Professor Bishay of CSUN. As he is the sponsor of the project, he and his team will provide a foot controller, which is the focal point of the project. The other major contribution is from CSUN itself, which provided funding for the hardware aspects of the project.

Professor Bishay extended the opportunity to our team to help create a virtual demonstration of using the prosthetic arm and the foot controller that Professor Bishay and his team created. The primary problem that this project aims to combat is that people who greatly struggle to use the prosthetic get discouraged and look for alternatives. We hope to empower transradial amputees by giving them a virtual environment to help them master the Infinity-2 foot controller and its operations and increase prosthetic retention rates.

Thank you to Professor Peter Bishay and Professor Li Liu for their advisement and guideance on this project.

### Project Architecture

### Overall Project Design
The overall project design represents our event-driven architecture as a flow diagram, showing the flow of data from the input all the way to how the game environment is rendered.

### Arm Flow
The arm flow displays how the input is given to the arm, and how the arm reacts to the input events it was given.

### Input Flow
The input architecture represents the flow of data from the multiple different types of input to the game, and showing where and how that data is transformed before reaching the arm for control.

### Level Flow
The level flow chart represents what the users will be doing and interacting with within the game level.

### Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram represents how the end-user will interact with our product, and the actors that will play a role in using the software.
