### Cain Coyco
My name is Cain Coyco, an ongoing Computer Science major; many of my family and friends refer to me as “the light of the party.” This is because I tend to always come into the room with a positive attitude and comedic relief. I am no stranger to public speaking and taking leadership roles in team environments. I have a wide array of skills; from Agile techniques to Java proficiency to communication, I will be able to adapt and overcome any obstacles that come my way while working towards my end goals.

### Samuel Lee
My government name is Samuel but I like to go by Sam. I took an interest in computer science because of my love of video games - that was a mistake. Now I am in my fourth year and it is too late to quit. Throughout my four years, I learned Java, HTML, MIPS assembly language, and now I am starting to learn C. One of my bucket list is to experience what it’s like to develop a game.

### Brian Kaddu
My name is Brian Kaddu and I'm generally a carefree and easygoing person but I get serious about things I'm passionate about. In this project I plan to expand and develop my skills as a software developer. As an asipring hobby game developer this project will be a great opportunity to learn 3d and vr game development in a group environment. Learning new skills and engineering software at the same time will be difficult but I believe the challenges can be overcome using teamwork and specialization.
