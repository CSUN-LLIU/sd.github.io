### Vision Statement
The Infinity Arm VR Demo is designed for transradial amputees seeking to be fitted with a prosthetic arm. The main focus of our demo, is to train users with the mechanics of the Infinity-2 Foot Controller. Our demo also gives the user a cost-effective opportunity to train with the Foot Controller, as well as removes any uncertainties before being fitted with a prosthetic arm. Our project, compared to other VR demos, looks beyond the prosthetic arm itself and focuses on enabling transradial amputees with the ability to adapt to any prosthetic arms with their new found skills with the Infinity-2 Foot Controller.

### Problem Statement
Often, transradial amputees feel discouraged when they struggle to operate a physical prosthetic arm resulting in low prosthetic retention rates. Our team plans to provide a virtual demo to help familiarize them with the foot controls that operate the prosthetic arm. 

- Problem: Discouragement from initial difficulties of a prosthetic arm
- Solution: User-friendly virtual training experience
---
- Problem: Possible prosthetic rejection
- Solution: Learning to manipulate a virtual prosthetic using the foot controllers 
---
- Problem: Financially inaccessible to many 
- Solution: A virtual environment is more cost effective

### Project Overview
#### Acknowledgement & Origin
The project was brought to us by Professor Bishay of CSUN. As he is the sponsor of the project, he and his team will provide a foot controller, which is the focal point of the project. The other major contribution is from CSUN itself, which provided funding for the hardware aspects of the project.

Professor Bishay extended the opportunity to our team to help create a virtual demonstration of using the prosthetic arm and the foot controller that Professor Bishay and his team created. The primary problem that this project aims to combat is that people who greatly struggle to use the prosthetic get discouraged and look for alternatives. We hope to empower transradial amputees by giving them a virtual environment to help them master the Infinity-2 foot controller and its operations and increase prosthetic retention rates.

Thank you to Professor Peter Bishay and Professor Li Liu for their advisement and guideance on this project.
