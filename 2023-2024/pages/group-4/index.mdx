### Vision Statement
The Infinity Arm VR Demo is designed for transradial amputees seeking to be fitted with a prosthetic arm. The main focus of our demo, is to train users with the mechanics of the Infinity-2 Foot Controller. Our demo also gives the user a cost-effective opportunity to train with the Foot Controller, as well as removes any uncertainties before being fitted with a prosthetic arm. Our project, compared to other VR demos, looks beyond the prosthetic arm itself and focuses on enabling transradial amputees with the ability to adapt to any prosthetic arms with their new found skills with the Infinity-2 Foot Controller.

### Problem Statement
Often, transradial amputees feel discouraged when they struggle to operate a physical prosthetic arm resulting in low prosthetic retention rates. Our team plans to provide a virtual demo to help familiarize them with the foot controls that operate the prosthetic arm. 

- Problem: Discouragement from initial difficulties of a prosthetic arm
- Solution: User-friendly virtual training experience
---
- Problem: Possible prosthetic rejection
- Solution: Learning to manipulate a virtual prosthetic using the foot controllers 
---
- Problem: Financially inaccessible to many 
- Solution: A virtual environment is more cost effective
