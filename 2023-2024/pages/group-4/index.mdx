### Vision Statement
The Infinity Arm is designed for transradial amputees who are looking to be fitted for the Infinity-2 “below-the-elbow” prosthetic arm. The Infinity Arm VR Demo is a virtual training that allows amputees to practice/train with the Infinity-2 prosthetic arm before fitting. Unlike other prosthetic arms and their control schemes, our product uses buttons within a foot sole (provided by Dr. Bishay and his team) in order to control finger movements. It also gives the user a cost-effective opportunity to help acquire the necessary skills and experience to use the Infinity-2 before being fitted for the physical prosthetic.

### Problem Statement
To provide a simulation platform for the Infinity-2 prosthetic arm for amputees who may be unsure about the prosthetic arm. This platform will simulate a virtual training environment that allows them to practice using the arm before continuing to use the physical prosthetic.

### Project Overview
