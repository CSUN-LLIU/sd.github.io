### Vision Statement

At AAC SARGIK, our vision is dedicated to empowering the voices of individuals who
need communication and speech assistance. People will use AAC SARGIK to be able to express themselves and better communicate with those around them. We provide a patient-friendly, inclusive, and customizable solution, enabling seamless communication to reduce the financial burden
on individuals and bridge the gap left by existing iOS-only options.

### Problem Statement

Aphasia, Dysarthria, and Apraxia pose significant difficulty for individuals,
impacting their ability to express themselves due to various
neurological conditions. Existing AAC solutions are largely
limited to costly iOS devices, creating accessibility challenges.
There's a serious need for an inclusive, affordable, and user-friendly Web and Android AAC application tailored to help those suffering from such communication disorders. This innovative solution aims to improve communication, bridging the gap for affected individuals and improving their quality of life.
