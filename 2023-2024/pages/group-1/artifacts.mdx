##### Archtectural Diagram

<div className="architecure">
  <Image src={Archtecture_img} alt="Archtectural DIagram" />
  <p>
  - The architectural framework used in the architecture of 
  the AAC SARGIK application is the Model, View, and Controller 
  design pattern. The Model is responsible for interacting with the 
  Azure MySQL database through entity classes (mapping the structure 
  of our entities) and LINQ statements for querying. The Controller component is
   responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data from the Model, and determining 
   the appropriate actions to take. The view is responsible for rendering the user interface and p
   resenting data from the user as received from the model. The five major components of our application 
   are the User Interface, the Angular View, the ASP.NET controller, the Model Component, and the data 
   source consisting of the Azure MySQL Database and the Azure Blob Storage.

##### Use Case Diagram
<div className="use-case">
  <Image src={UseCase_img} alt="Use Case Diagram" />
  <p>
    - The use case Diagram showcases how the end user will interact with our
    application, giving an abstract view of the main features that our
    application will provide. As we can see from the Diagram the user will
    authenticate when accessing our application, after which he will be able to
    use our interactive keyboard to type words and be assisted by our AI word
    prediction feature and AI image recommendation feature. The user will also
    be able to interact with the visual scene display where he will be able to
    upload photos and take photos using the device's camera after which he will
    be able to draw hotspots (bounding boxes) around the objects in the image
    and be assisted by our AI to predict words and text related to the selected
    object which will be communicated through the device's speaker if the user
    approves the word and text.

##### Figure 3: Deployment Diagram
<div className="deployment">
  <Image src={Deployment_img} alt="Deployment Diagram" />
  <p>
  - In the U.I. Design section, we present the prototype design of our main U.I. components. 
  Our main focus is developing a clean and easy-to-use user interface. Our application will be
   personalized for people with Dysarthria and Apraxia offering clear visuals, and minimal complexity 
   taking into account the user's challenges in motor coordination and speech articulation. The user will 
   first interact with our Azure Active Directory personalized page to log into the system. 
   After which the interactive keyboard will be displayed and the user can start interacting
   with our application. The user will also be able to access the Visual Scene Display from the 
   middle button above the keyboard. When the button is pressed a modal box representing the visual 
   scene display will be displayed with the option to capture a photo or upload a photo to the visual scene display where the 
  user will be able to use the draw hotspot and text-prediction based on image functionality.
  </p>

##### Component Diagram
<div className="component">
  <Image src={Component_img} alt="Component Diagram" />
  <p>
- The Component Diagram represents the collection of the major components such 
as the Model, View, and Controller, and also the significant subcomponents that 
represent the building blocks of the major components. The purpose of the component 
diagram is to show the relationship between the components, how they communicate with each other, 
and how they depend on each other. As we can see from the diagram subcomponents from both the view and 
controller depend on the authentication and user sessions
given by Azure Active Directory which is a cloud identity and access management.
