### Vision Statement

Our vision is to make virtual reality inclusive by enabling everyone to immerse themselves fully
in the virtual world. We're trying to make a product that's compatible with people who have an
amputated arm or an arm that have lost its motor ability due to a stroke. Standard VR platforms
like the Meta Quest or Playstation VR have very limited options in terms of accessibility and
most people with handicaps are unable to enjoy many VR games. Our project aims to eliminate
these limitations, allowing everyone to enjoy an immersive VR experience, regardless of their
upper-body function.


### Problem Statement

The "Magic Hand" VR Input Switching Program aims to create a more inclusive VR experience to
those with upper-body limitations as relies on a single VR controller for bimanual operations
unlike standard VR platforms that force the users into using both hands. 

### Project Overview

Our Unity Engine-based VR project, is focused on developing an alternative input system using
the XR Interaction Toolkit that goes beyond traditional buttons, triggers, and pads. Users will
seamlessly select, drag, rotate, and scale virtual objects within the VR environment. Unique to
our approach is the implementation of a one-handed bimanual operation by switching between left
and right controllers with integrated voice commands, gestures, and button combination inputs.
Additionally, the project will feature a demo environment comprised of testing stages to 
demonstrate our proof-of-concept as well running through game stages.
