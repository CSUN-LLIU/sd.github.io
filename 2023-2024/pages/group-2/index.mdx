### Vision Statement

Our vision is to make virtual reality inclusive by enabling everyone to immerse themselves fully
in the virtual world. We aim to transform the VR experience for users who cannot use one hand
for a handheld controller by providing alternate input devices. Unlike standard VR platforms like
Oculus and Playstation VR, our product, the *\<Foot Arm Controller Thing>*&trade;, does not rely
on handheld controllers that assume upper-body movement capability for amputees and individuals
with upper-body limitations. The *\<Foot Arm Controller Thing>*&trade; eliminates these limitations,
allowing everyone to enjoy an immersive virtual reality experience, regardless of their upper-body
function.
