# CSUN COMP490 Website â€” 2023-2024

The site uses [nextra](https://nextra.site/) to statically generate a site based on MDX (markdown + jsx) files.

The routes are already defined in `pages/` as MDX files.

You can edit any of the files within your group and use standard [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to edit the content.

Any photos should be put into `public/group-n/*.png` where n is the group number.
