        <p>
          Currently advising students takes a considerable amount of time and
          with the explosion of student enrollment it is time consuming for the
          advisors. This leads to delayed response times for the students and
          advisors do not have adequate time to give detailed advisement.
        </p>

          What is your project idea and how will it work (what are its
          components etc.)
        </h1>
        <p>
          We believe there is a big opportunity to alleviate advisor`s time by
          automating the majority of questions being asked to them. We will be
          creating a product that can dynamically create a roadmap depending on
          the student`s needs and preferences (Full time student/preferred
          discipline, etc). This will give the student exactly what classes they
          need to take and in what order (Some classes have prerequisites). This
          will also help with negating user errors and help navigate them
          through their academic career and ensuring they only take the classes
          they need. With the support and guidance of multiple faculty members,
          this can revolutionize academic advisement and give students and
          advisors a product they can have confidence in.
