Our project was built in Unity and is intended to run on the Oculus/Meta Quest 2. Because the program is built on the feedback and sources provided by the CSUN Nursing Department, it focuses on allowing CSUN nursing students to apply what they have learned, or are currently learning, from the course curriculum. Additionally, the program provides a feature which allows users to answer a performance checklist while using the program. This performance checklist prompts the user to record their deductions and findings when diagnosing the simulated patient. This same checklist can be submitted by the user to receive feedback on whether their findings about the patient were accurate. Nursing VR can be improved by additional features including more examinations focusing on different body systems, and an aspiring feature such as one that allows the user to give vocal commands and questions to the simulated patient."})}),(0,s.jsx)("br",{}),(0,s.jsx)("hr",{}),(0,s.jsx)("br",{}),(0,s.jsx)("h2",{children:"Problem"}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{style:{textAlign:"justify"},className:"indent",children:(0,s.jsx)("p",{style:{textIndent:"5em"},children:"There are nursing students who do not have effective patient subjects to practice their diagnosing techniques and their assessments on.
