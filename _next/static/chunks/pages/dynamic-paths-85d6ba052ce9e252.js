This eliminates user errors and it helps create an easy roadmap unlike third party planners that can introduce errors. We offer suggestions for different paths and create modular visualizations of students' overall academic classes.\n    "},{id:2,title:"General Solution Approach",info:"We will be creating a website that current CSUN freshman's will have access to. \n    This tool will help students visualize their degree road map with all GE's included. \n    This will improve students' understanding of their degree pathway. We provide warnings if they are missing requirements or prerequisites.\n     We are passionate about students feeling confident in the classes they are taking that will progress them in their degree. This project will help students save money and effort and ensure they feel confident in finishing their degree.\n    We hope to help students achieve their goals in the most efficient way possible and have confidence in their academic future. The output of this project will be to create a tool to streamline and automate advisement for CSUN students and Faculty."},{id:3,title:"What is your project idea and how will it work (what are its components etc.)",info:"We believe there is a big opportunity to alleviate advisor's time by\n    automating the majority of questions being asked to them. We will be\n    creating a product that can dynamically create a road map depending on\n    the student's needs and preferences (Full time student/preferred\n    discipline, etc). This will give the student exactly what classes they\n    need to take and in what order (Some classes have prerequisites). This\n    will also help with negating user errors and help navigate them\n    through their academic career and ensuring they only take the classes\n    they need. With the support and guidance of multiple faculty members,\n    this can revolutionize academic advisement and give students and\n    advisors a product they can have confidence in."},],o=function(e){var t=e.person;return(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:s().container,children:[(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:s().title,children:(0,i.jsx)("h1",{children:t.title})}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:s().info,children:t.info})]})},d=function(){return(0,i.jsx)("div",{children:r.map(function(e){return(0,i.jsx)(o,{person:e},e.id)})})};t.default=d},7274:function(e){e.exports={container:"Members_container__MCn4A",name:"Members_name__UngnO",title:"Members_title__1bJyf",image:"Members_image__mSUTB",info:"Members_info__yl_i7"}}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=7990)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
