All these technologies can provide a fascinatingly amazing game<br/>experiance which can lead to new insights into experiancing life. However all of these implementations can lead to some confusion, a tsunami of information.<br/>This often times can instead of creating wonder, will cause discord with the player base.<br/></p><h2>The Problem</h2><p> In our research we have found this troubling problem affecting our community. Often times, a new game will come up with no tutorial or have a confusing<br/>way to play that can infuriate the player. Enraged the player will then rage in an onine forum or demand a refund claiming the game has broken mechanics.<br/>The problem is exacerbated by the decline of offical game guides which were prevalent from the advent of video games until the early 2010s and <br/>the advent of streaming via Twitch or YouTube where an expecation is set when a person is watching who is intrested in a new game.<br/>A player then wants to get that same experiance but with no recording, article or other information and often times little patience, would then <br/>loose it in the heat of battle. These experiances can be troubling and dissaude game develepers from wanting to create new intricate games.<br/></p><h2>Thinking outside the box</h2><p> Our proposed solution for this problem is to create an AI helper called Venus that can learn the players play-style and situations where the player is having difficulty.<br/>The proof of concept would take this AI helper and apply it to a confusingly fun browser based game called <strong><a herf="https://the-house.arturkot.pl/"> The House </a></strong>by Arthur Kot<br/>As the game is browser based we will have to implement a way to capture the users gameplay then send this back to the users game state to allow the new solution to play out.<br/></p><h3>Venus requirements</h3><p>* Capture users mouse acceleration and use machine learning to anazlye the telemetry *<br/>  - Mouse accleration is dependent on spikes in user movement, the large the spike, the more confused the user<br/><br/>* Game data provides a foundation for our machine learning algorithim to search out the best solution *<br/>  - Using mL5, a tensorflow based Javascript library, we aim to provide an excelent solution<br/><br/>* Venus would provide hints at the users request, it waits for the user, it will never play the game for them *<br/>  - We want to give the user the full satisfaction of playing and winning at the game. <br/><br/>* Data created by the solution would be created just in time, nothing is saved *<br/>  - User data in this modern era is tantamount to gold, keeping it temporarily is our goal.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/gryffindor","query":{},"buildId":"060BNxz8mGsCMkB41Yzr3","assetPrefix":"/sd.github.io","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
